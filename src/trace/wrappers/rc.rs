//! A reference-counted wrapper sharing one owned trace.
//!
//! The types in this module, `TraceBox` and `TraceRc` and meant to parallel `RcBox` and `Rc` in `std::rc`.
//!
//! The first typee is an owned trace with some information about the cumulative requirements of the shared
//! handles. This is roughly how much progress has each made, so we know which "read capabilities" they have
//! collectively dropped, and when it is safe to inform the trace of such progress.
//!
//! The second type is a wrapper which presents as a `TraceReader`, but whose methods for advancing its read
//! capabilities interact with the `TraceBox` rather than directly with the owned trace. Ideally, instances
//! `TraceRc` should appear indistinguishable from the underlying trace from a reading perspective, with the
//! exception that the trace may not compact its representation as fast as if it were exclusively owned.
