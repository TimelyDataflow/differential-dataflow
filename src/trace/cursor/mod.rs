//! Traits and types for navigating order sequences of update tuples.
//!
//! The `Cursor` trait contains several methods for efficiently navigating ordered collections
//! of tuples of the form `(key, val, time, diff)`. The cursor is different from an iterator
//! both because it allows navigation on multiple levels (key and val), but also because it
//! supports efficient seeking (via the `seek_key` and `seek_val` methods).
