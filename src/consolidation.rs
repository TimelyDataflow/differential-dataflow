//! Common logic for the consolidation of vectors of Semigroups.
//!
//! Often we find ourselves with collections of records with associated weights (often
//! integers) where we want to reduce the collection to the point that each record occurs
//! at most once, with the accumulated weights. These methods supply that functionality.
//!
//! Importantly, these methods are used internally by differential dataflow, but are made
//! public for the convenience of others. Their precise behavior is driven by the needs of
//! differential dataflow (chiefly: canonicalizing sequences of non-zero updates); should
//! you need specific behavior, it may be best to defensively copy, paste, and maintain the
//! specific behavior you require.
