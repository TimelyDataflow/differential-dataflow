//! A type that can be treated as a difference.
//!
//! Differential dataflow most commonly tracks the counts associated with records in a multiset, but it
//! generalizes to tracking any map from the records to an Abelian group. The most common generalization
//! is when we maintain both a count and another accumulation, for example height. The differential
//! dataflow collections would then track for each record the total of counts and heights, which allows
//! us to track something like the average.
