//! Types and traits associated with collections of data.
//!
//! The `Collection` type is differential dataflow's core abstraction for an updatable pile of data.
//!
//! Most differential dataflow programs are "collection-oriented", in the sense that they transform
//! one collection into another, using operators defined on collections. This contrasts with a more
//! imperative programming style, in which one might iterate through the contents of a collection
//! manually. The higher-level of programming allows differential dataflow to provide efficient
//! implementations, and to support efficient incremental updates to the collections.

/// A mutable collection of values of type `D`
///
/// The `Collection` type is the core abstraction in differential dataflow programs. As you write your
/// differential dataflow computation, you write as if the collection is a static dataset to which you
/// apply functional transformations, creating new collections. Once your computation is written, you
/// are able to mutate the collection (by inserting and removing elements); differential dataflow will
/// propagate changes through your functional computation and report the corresponding changes to the
/// output collections.
///
/// Each collection has three generic parameters. The parameter `G` is for the scope in which the
/// collection exists; as you write more complicated programs you may wish to introduce nested scopes
/// (e.g. for iteration) and this parameter tracks the scope (for timely dataflow's benefit). The `D`
/// parameter is the type of data in your collection, for example `String`, or `(u32, Vec<Option<()>>)`.
/// The `R` parameter represents the types of changes that the data undergo, and is most commonly (and
/// defaults to) `isize`, representing changes to the occurrence count of each record.
