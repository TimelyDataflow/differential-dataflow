//! Iterative application of a differential dataflow fragment.
//!
//! The `iterate` operator takes as an argument a closure from a differential dataflow collection
//! to a collection of the same type. The output collection is the result of applying this closure
//! an unbounded number of times.
//!
//! The implementation of `iterate` does not directly apply the closure, but rather establishes an
//! iterative timely dataflow subcomputation, in which differences circulate until they dissipate
//! (indicating that the computation has reached fixed point), or until some number of iterations
//! have passed.
//!
//! **Note**: The dataflow assembled by `iterate` does not automatically insert `consolidate` for
//! you. This means that either (i) you should insert one yourself, (ii) you should be certain that
//! all paths from the input to the output of the loop involve consolidation, or (iii) you should
//! be worried that logically cancelable differences may circulate indefinitely.
//!
//! # Details
//!
//! The `iterate` method is written using a `Variable`, which lets you define your own iterative
//! computations when `iterate` itself is not sufficient. This can happen when you have two
//! collections that should evolve simultaneously, or when you would like to rotate your loop and
//! return an intermediate result.
//!
//! Using `Variable` requires more explicit arrangement of your computation, but isn't much more
//! complicated. You must define a new variable from an existing stream (its initial value), and
//! then set it to be a function of this variable (and perhaps other collections and variables).
//!
//! A `Variable` dereferences to a `Collection`, the one corresponding to its value in each iteration,
//! and it can be used in most situations where a collection can be used. The act of setting a
//! `Variable` consumes it and returns the corresponding `Collection`, preventing you from setting
//! it multiple times.
