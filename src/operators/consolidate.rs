//! Aggregates the weights of equal records into at most one record.
//!
//! As differential dataflow streams are unordered and taken to be the accumulation of all records,
//! no semantic change happens via `consolidate`. However, there is a practical difference between
//! a collection that aggregates down to zero records, and one that actually has no records. The
//! underlying system can more clearly see that no work must be done in the later case, and we can
//! drop out of, e.g. iterative computations.
//!
//! #Examples
//!
//! This example performs a standard "word count", where each line of text is split into multiple
//! words, each word is converted to a word with count 1, and `consolidate` then accumulates the
//! counts of equivalent words.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! stream.flat_map(|line| line.split_whitespace())
//!       .map(|word| (word, 1))
//!       .consolidate();
//! ```
