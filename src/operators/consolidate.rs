//! Aggregates the weights of equal records into at most one record.

//! As differential dataflow streams are unordered and taken to be the accumulation of all records,
//! no semantic change happens via `consolidate`. However, there is a practical difference between
//! a collection that aggregates down to zero records, and one that actually has no records. The
//! underlying system can more clearly see that no work must be done in the later case, and we can
//! drop out of, e.g. iterative computations.
