//! Dataflow operator for delta joins over partially ordered timestamps.
//!
//! Given multiple streams of updates `(data, time, diff)` that are each
//! defined over the same partially ordered `time`, we want to form the
//! full cross-join of all relations (we will *later* apply some filters
//! and instead equijoin on keys).
//!
//! The "correct" output is the outer join of these triples, where
//!   1. The `data` entries are just tuple'd up together,
//!   2. The `time` entries are subjected to the lattice `join` operator,
//!   3. The `diff` entries are multiplied.
//!
//! One way to produce the correct output is to form independent dataflow
//! fragments for each input stream, such that each intended output is then
//! produced by exactly one of these input streams.
//!
//! There are several incorrect ways one might do this, but here is one way
//! that I hope is not incorrect:
//!
//! Each input stream of updates is joined with each other input collection,
//! where each input update is matched against each other input update that
//! has a `time` that is less-than the input update's `time`, *UNDER A TOTAL
//! ORDER ON `time`*. The output are the `(data, time, diff)` entries that
//! follow the rules above, except that we additionally preserve the input's
//! initial `time` as well, for use in subsequent joins with the other input
//! collections.
//!
//! There are some caveats about ties, and we should treat each `time` for
//! each input as occurring at distinct times, one after the other (so that
//! ties are resolved by the index of the input). There is also the matter
//! of logical compaction, which should not be done in a way that prevents
//! the correct determination of the total order comparison.
