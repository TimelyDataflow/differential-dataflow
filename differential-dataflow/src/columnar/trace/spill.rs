//! Per-worker spill control for the columnar `Chunk` trace.
//!
//! [`ColChunk`](super::ColChunk) is either resident (a trie in
//! memory) or paged (resident bounds + a byte handle to fetch the trie back).
//! `Chunk::settle` is where committed chunks may be **paged out**: it calls
//! [`try_page`], which consults a per-worker [`SpillState`] and, when over budget,
//! serializes the trie and hands the bytes to a pluggable [`BytesStore`]. Reads
//! ([`Chunk::merge`](crate::trace::chunk::Chunk::merge) etc., and the cursor) fetch paged chunks back on demand.
//!
//! The backend is pluggable: a worker calls [`install`] with its own
//! [`BytesStore`] (e.g. file-backed). With nothing installed, no chunk is ever
//! paged and `ColChunk` stays resident — zero overhead beyond a thread-local peek.
//!
//! # Known limitation
//!
//! `settle` sees only its **local** committed output, not the whole batcher
//! queue (timely's `MergeBatcher` does not expose it, and the shared `settle` is
//! generic so it can't notify a columnar-specific accountant per consumed chunk).
//! So the eviction policy is a simple per-worker **high-water mark**: keep the
//! first `budget_records` worth of committed chunks resident, page the rest. It
//! bounds the resident set and round-trips through the store correctly, but it
//! favours keeping older data and can't reclaim budget as data leaves — coarser
//! than the exact head-reserve-over-the-queue policy the old bespoke batcher ran.
