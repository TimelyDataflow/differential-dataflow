//! The `reduce` operator acts on `(key, val)` data.
//! Records with the same key are grouped together, and a user-supplied reduction function is applied
//! to the key and the list of values.
//! The function is expected to populate a list of output values.
//!
//! The output can change at times that are joins of input times, not only at input times themselves,
//! and the operator must determine at which times to re-evaluate the reduction. A machine-checked
//! account of which times suffice lives in `formal/Differential/Coverage.lean`.
