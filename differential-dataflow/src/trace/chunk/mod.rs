//! Sorted, consolidated runs of updates, and operators over sequences of them.
//!
//! A [`Chunk`] is a consolidated, sorted run of `(data, time, diff)` updates.
//! A sequence of chunks is also expected to be consolidated and sorted.
//!
//! The [`Chunk`] trait exposes whole-chunk operations, so that the implementor
//! can internally divert to their best implementations, with amortized overhead.
//! Each operation is invoked as if "streaming", providing input and output queues.
//! An implementor is expected to drain as much as possible of the inputs, and any
//! chunk written to the output is "committed" and likely to be shipped onward.
//!
//! # Wiring a `Chunk` into an arrangement
//!
//! Implementing [`Chunk`] for a type `C` is the only bespoke code needed; three
//! aliases then expand into a full trace:
//!
//! * [`ChunkBatcher<C>`](ChunkBatcher) — the merge batcher.
//! * [`ChunkBuilder<C>`](ChunkBuilder) — the batch builder.
//! * [`ChunkSpine<C>`](ChunkSpine) — the trace, a spine of `Rc`-shared batches.
//!
//! These are the `Batcher` / `Builder` / `Spine` to hand to
//! [`arrange_core`](crate::operators::arrange::arrangement::arrange_core), along with a
//! chunker that forms `C` from the input stream — typically
//! [`ContainerChunker<C>`](crate::trace::implementations::chunker::ContainerChunker).
//! Everything else here ([`ChunkBatch`], [`ChunkMerger`], [`ChunkBatchMerger`],
//! [`ChunkBatchCursor`], [`ChunkBatchBuilder`]) is machinery those aliases expand to and is
//! not named directly. The [`vec`](mod@vec) module is a worked `Chunk`
//! that re-exports the three aliases specialized to its layout, and the `chunks` example
//! stands one up.
//!
//! # Bounded footprint
//!
//! There is a `TARGET` associated constant that signals the intended chunk size.
//! The constant should be chosen large enough to amortize overheads, but small
//! enough that per-chunk work does not "stall" the system when invoked.
//! The implementor is trusted to make a reasonable choice here.
//!
//! The [`Chunk::settle`] method "settles" sequences of chunks, and is called as
//! chunks are no longer expected to be needed in the near future. The implementor
//! should ensure the chunks are "graded", in that the sequence of chunks are all
//! at most `TARGET` in size, any two in order sum to strictly more than `TARGET`.
//! This is also an opportunity to compress data, or spill to disk or cloud storage.
//!
//! The active (un-settled) chunk set is kept small from both sides. Every producer
//! settles its committed output as it goes (see [`Chunk::settle`]), rather than
//! building a whole sequence and settling at the end. And every walk over a whole
//! chunk sequence reads only resident metadata — [`len`](Chunk::len) and
//! [`bounds`](Chunk::bounds) — never a chunk body: a batch indexes its chunks'
//! bounds once at construction, so cursors binary-search that resident index and
//! open only the chunk(s) a query touches. Implementors must therefore keep `len`
//! and `bounds` cheap even when a chunk's body is paged out.
